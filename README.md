# ETL - Short Project

Analysts: Sarah Zachrich, Madison Chamberlain, Kevin Schram, Robin Bun, Andrew Marino

Data Type: Video game data based on Steam (a cloud-based gaming library)

Objective: We are to find data from multiple sources (including APIs and scaping if necessary) to create tables/collections that are stored in a database to be available for use in future projects. Once we have identified our datasets we must perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) on the data to clean it up and make any necessary joins or filtering, etc... This data will then be loaded into a final database. 

A final project report is included explaining the data we found and the steps we had to take to format it correctly for what we wanted in our final database.
